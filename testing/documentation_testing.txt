TESTING DOCUMENTATION

// ALGORITHM FOR TESTING LLM
1. Pull the data out of a csv file and save as dataset.js (using readCSV.js file)
2. Use symptom phrases to generate diagnosis with LLM.
3. Compare LLM diagnosis with diagnosis from the dataset.
4. Save the result in a correctAnswers Array (true/false)
5. Count the amount of correct and wrong answers, give it out in terminal


// INSTALLATION STEPS
1. Run the following command to install csv for reading the test csv data file.
npm install csv

// RUNNING THE TEST PROGRAM
1. Go into the 'testing' folder and run:
node datasetTest

// KNOWN BUGS
1. When running the program on a large file, the system can't handle it,
so I divided the dataset file into three files


// LATEST RUN RESULTS: dataset (first dataset, two more remaining)
Amount of correct answers
75
Amount of wrong answers
258
