TESTING DOCUMENTATION

// ALGORITHM FOR TESTING LLM
1. Pull the data out of a csv file and save as dataset.js (using readCSV.js file)
2. Use symptom phrases to generate diagnosis with LLM.
3. Compare LLM diagnosis with diagnosis from the dataset.
4. Save the result in a correctAnswers Array (true/false)
5. Count the amount of correct and wrong answers, give it out in terminal


// INSTALLATION STEPS
1. Run the following command to install csv for reading the test csv data file.
npm install csv

// RUNNING THE TEST PROGRAM
1. Go into the 'testing' folder and run:
node datasetTest

// KNOWN BUGS
1. When generating symptoms sometimes the LLM adds in spaces '_'.
For example: 'neck_pain'. This leads to a normal, proper activation of the function.

// not problematic
Symptomtext:  My neck has been extremely tight and my muscles have been feeling extremely weak. My joints have been swollen and Ive been walking around with a lot of stiffness. Additionally, walking has been extremely uneasy.
Symptoms Array: [

  'weakness',
  'muscle_weakness',

Sometimes the spaces are not there at all: 'balanceissues'
